# Final Project
## All About Me
For the final project in our online coding class, we were told to create a website telling a little bit about ourselves. So this is my attempt at doing just that. Let's all hope and pray it goes well. :)

### Interests and Hobbies

So first off I will be telling you all about my current interests and hobbies. Well first I should inform you that I am the nerdiest, and the geekiest person you will probably ever meet. I love a lot of animes like:
- **FairyTail**           
- **Haikyuu**
- **Oran Host Club**

I am also a huge reader who's in love with a variety of books. For example:
- _Shadowhunter Series_
- _Gone the Series_
- _The Red Queen_
- _Daughter of Smoke and Bone_

[More about the Gone Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_(novel_series)#:~:text=Gone%20is%20a%20bestselling%20book,aged%2015%20and%20older%20vanishes.&text=The%20second%20book%2C%20Hunger%2C%20was,%2C%20on%20May%204%2C%202010.)

Reading, writing, and watching good stories have been stories have always been a huge comfort to me. I also found out not too long ago I like to embroider little images and while I'm not the best currently I'm excited to keep learning. 

### A Little Deeper into my Personality. 
To be a little more personal with you all I guess I could start with that I come from a big family. My dad has eight sisters while my mom only has three which means I have a lot of cousins. I am also the youngest of five siblings and I am my dad's first girl (though I do have an older sister from a separate marriage on my mom's side). While I was the youngest out of all my siblings I had the most expectations put on my shoulders. I am the first generation in my giant family to go to college (which is huge since I come from a family of migrant farmworkers). 

### My Past and Current Struggles
I also have the recessive genes from my grandma who is almost full Cherokee Indian so I don't look like my siblings and honestly, my parents and I have gotten a lot of crap for it for most of my life. I was either assumed to be mixed, or some other culture (Mexican, Hawaiian, etc), or people asked me if I was sure I wasn't adopted. My dad even had to drop some people from his life who tried to convince him to get a paternity test done to prove I was his blood (he of course refused). If that wasn't enough I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety and depression when I was ten years old. My family would treat me like glass or just avoid me together to "try to not overwhelm me", which honestly made everything worse. I have since been to therapy and now have an emotional support cat who I love and have been taught ways to work around my anxiety. They both are still big hurdles in my everyday life but it's honestly better than it's ever been.

### Future Plans
While my plans for the future continue to change for me I am still very excited to see what's to come. At the beginning of my college career, I was sure I wanted to code for a living but as the semester went on I found I missed reading and writing a lot. (and to be honest, the math just wasn't for me). So I found while I love coding by itself it was probably best to just keep it as a little hobby to do from time to time. Currently, I am double majoring in psychology and English and I hope to one day be a trauma psychiatrist who is also an established author of her very own sci-fi or fantasy series.

### Hopes for the Future

While I know some things are not set in stone I do have some goals I plan on achieving in my lifetime. For example, I plan on taking my dad to see the northern lights as soon as I get the money to take him. I want to make him proud and show that while I can be independent and support myself, I will also always be there for him and my mom. I also want to show him that all the hard work and tears and support had a good outcome and were worth the stress and time put in. Another would be to own a wolf-dog. Wolfs have always been my favorite animal and being able to own and support and love a wolf dog is one of my biggest personal dreams. I also want to buy a big house for future generations of my family to live in. As someone who always had to move around a lot, I want my future family to be able to always have a place to call home and feel safe and secure enough to call it home.
