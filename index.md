## All About Me

For the final project in our online coding class we were told to create a website telling a little bit about ourselves. So this is my attempt at doing just that. Lets all hope and pray it goes well. :)

### Interests and Hobbies

So first off I will be tellign you all about my current interests and hobbies. Well first I should inform you that i am the nerdiest, and geekiest person you will probably every meet. I love a lot of animes like:
- **FairyTail**
- **Haikyuu**
- **Oran Host Club**

I am also a huge reader who's in love with a variety of books. For example:
- _Shadowhunter Series_
- _The Gone Series_
- _The Red Queen_
- _Daughter of Smoke and Bone_

Reading, writing, and watching good stories have been stories have always been a huge comfort to me. I also found out not to long ago i like to embroider little images and while I'm not the best currently im excited to keep learning. 

### A Little Deeper into my Personality. 
To be a little more personal with you all I guess I could start with that I come from a big family. My dad has eight sisters while my mom only has three which means I have a lot of cousins. I am also the youngest of five sibling and I am my dad's first girl (though I do have an older sister from a separate marriage on my mom side). While I was the youngest out of all my sibling I had the most expectations put on my shoulders. I am a first generation in  my giant family to go to college (which is huge since I come from a family of mirgant farm workers). 

### My Past and Current Struggles
I also have the recessive genes from my grandma who is almost full Cherokee Indian so I don't really look like my siblings and honestly, my parents and I have gotten a lot of crap for it for most of my life. I was either assumed to be mixed, or some other culture (Mexican, Hawaiian, ect) or people asked me if I was sure I wasn't adopted. My dad even had to drop some people from his life who tried to convince him to get a paternity test done to prove I was his blood (he of course refused). If that wasn't enough I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety and depression when I was ten years old. My family would treat me like glass or just avoid me all together to "try to not overwelm me", which honestly made everything worse. I have since been to therapy and now have an emotiona support cat who I love and have been taught ways to work around my anxiety. They both are still big hurdles in my everyday life but it's honestly better than its every been.  


### Future Plans
While my plans for the future continoue to change for me I still very excited to see whats to come. In the begining of my college career I was sure I wanted to code for a living but as the semster went on i found i missed reading and writing alot. (and to be honest the math just wasn't for me). So I found while I love coding by itself I was probably best to just keep it as a little hobby to do from time to time. Currently I am double majoring in psychology and English and I hope to one day be a trauam psychiatist who is also an established author of her own sci-fi or fantasy series. 

### Hopes for the Future

While I know some things are not set in stone I do have some goals I plan on achieve in my life time. For example I plan on taking my dad to see the northern lights as soon as i get the money to take him. I want to make him proud and show that while I cna be independant and support myself, I will also always be there for him and my mom. ANother would be to own a wolf dog. Wolfs have always been my favorite animal and being able to own and support and love a wolf dog is one of my biggest personal dreams. I also want to buy a big house for future generations of my family to live. As someone who always had to move around a lot I want my future family to be able to always have a place to call home and feel and be safe in.
